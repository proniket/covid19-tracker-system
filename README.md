## Introduction
This is a code repository for the corresponding COVID-19 Tracker System project. 

Created a full COVID-19 Tracker. Utilized React, Charts.JS and Material UI.

Got a strong understanding of React's workflow and the use of hooks.

API used: https://covid19.mathdro.id/api

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start```
